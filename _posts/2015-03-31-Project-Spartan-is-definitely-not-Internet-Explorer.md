Late on Monday evening, well, late for me here in the UK at least, my Surface Pro running the Windows 10 preview told me there was a new update waiting for me. Microsoft recently promised more frequent releases for members of the Windows Insider program who'd chosen to adopt the "fast track" so it was good to see this. Whilst I waited for the update to download and install, a little idle browsing revealed that the most interesting aspect of this new update was the appearance of the first public release of Microsoft's new web browser, currently known as *[Project Spartan][spartan-blog]*.

There's been a lot of talk about this since its existence was first revealed towards the end of 2014. My initial thoughts were whether this was truly a new browser or just a modern front end sitting atop good old Internet Explorer. Actually, I shouldn't really say "Good Old" Internet Explorer because I don't think there is a single person anywhere who would ever describe Internet Explorer as good. As an IT Pro and part time dev, Internet Explorer has long been the bane of my life. Whether it was trying to develop websites that rendered correctly on ancient versions of IE that were still in mass use, or finding I couldn't access "modern" websites from work because my corporate desktop still had a long dead version of IE as its default browser, as upgrading to a newer version would break countless Intranet applications. Internet Explorer has a poor reputation, which is a shame because in newer versions it was definitely getting better. Although even on my Windows 8.1 laptop with shiny new IE11, Firefox is still my default browser.

So after waiting patiently for my Surface Pro to upgrade to build 10049, Spartan had to be my first port of call.

They always say first impressions last and Spartan makes a good one. It looks like what you'd expect a modern web browser to look like. Modern applications are expected to get out of the way and make room for the content and that's clearly what Microsoft are doing here with Spartan. The start screen that you're taken to on first launch directs your attention to the content. You only notice the browser when you go looking for it.

Spartan gives me something that's been missing from my web browsing experience on Windows 10 so far. A tablet aware browser. Up until now, the web browser on Windows 10 has always been the standard desktop version of Internet Explorer 11 (although I think there is a hack that brings back the Metro / Modern version of IE). Using IE11 on a Surface Pro is a little bit fiddly and hitting the right target with your finger can be, well, hit and miss. Spartan is designed for touch and integrates well with Windows 10's Continuum feature. This is great because on Windows 8.x you had two completely separate Internet Explorer web browsers - Normal IE11 for the desktop and a Modern IE for touch. But now you have the same browser for regular desktops and tablets / touch devices. Using Spartan on a Surface Pro in tablet mode gives me the browsing experience I'd expect from a tablet browser.

Spartan includes Reading List and Reading View functionality. This is a nice feature that attempts to replicate the experience of something like Pocket or Instapaper, by stripping out any unnecessary sidebars, adverts and other distractions allowing you to focus on the article you're reading. I use this feature quite a bit when I'm using Internet Explorer on my Windows Phone - when you're reading from a small screen this feature is ideal. It's also useful on particularly noisy or difficult to navigate sites when using a tablet device. For these features to become truly useful to me though they need some offline support. A lot of what I send to Pocket is there so that I can read it when I'm not connected or don't have a reliable Internet connection, which is usually whilst I'm commuting or otherwise travelling. Offline support would also reduce my reliance on third party apps.

The other notable features include Cortana integration and annotation. The Cortana integration isn't enabled by default for me because I'm not in the U.S. and, to be honest, I've never been all that interested in that kind of thing. I've got Cortana on my Windows Phone and I barely use it, so although I know you can trick Cortana into working, I can't be bothered! The annotation features, which include the ability to draw on the web page, highlight content, add notes and clip content are currently being filed in my head under "gimmick" in so much as I can't say I've ever been using a web browser and lamented the absence of these features.

You cannot forget that Spartan is still in preview. You see those icons just above where it says "Reading List"? Well, only two of those actually do anything. The Browsing History and Downloads lists aren't implemented yet. But that's fine. This is a good, solid, preview release. I've been using it for the best part of a day now and so far it's been stable and hasn't crashed once. With Microsoft's promise of increased frequency of updates, I'm looking forward to this developing over the coming weeks and months. It looks like it still has a long way to go before Microsoft will convince people not to install Firefox or Chrome. For me, the plug-ins are the best features of those two browsers. But I'm a power user and for the average user, Spartan is looking like a good bet.
