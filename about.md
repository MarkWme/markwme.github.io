Hi! I'm Mark Whitby, welcome to my blog! I've been working in the world of Enterprise IT for more than 25 years. I like writing code to automate stuff, I hate doing anything more than once!

Most of my experience has been in the infrastructure side of things, working with Microsoft technologies and specialising in the Windows Server platform, PowerShell and Azure. I also like creating things and have developed iPhone Apps, Websites and API's using C#, .NET, Javascript and NodeJS.

I really should get out more.
